Data Processing is the script for the data computation pipeline, while example for running contains sample data that can be executed directly.

Using the 81_NMC dataset as an example, the Data Processing script sequentially handles the data and computes results. The discharge lower limit is 2.8V, and the charge upper limit is 4.25V (only constant current (CC) segments are selected, constant voltage (CV) is not considered for now). The output of each step serves as the input for the next step.

Data cleaning and segmentation
Output:

Processed data: Processed data storage file/{m}_chulihou.csv

Segment table: Processed data storage file_segments/{m}_tbl.csv

Preliminary filtering of applicable vehicles
Output:

Extracted data: Extracted data storage file/{name}data.csv

Segment info: Extracted data storage file_segments_tbl/{name}tbl04.csv

OCV-SOC curve acquisition
Output:

SOC-OCV curve parameters

PSO parameter identification in the 375V to 385V voltage range
Output:

Each vehicle produces a parameter identification result table with 11 parameters, stored in the Battery parameters/ directory

Supplementing temperature information
Intermediate output: data_with_temperature/{name}tbl04.csv
Subsequent reads:

r0_df = Battery parameters/{name}r0_df.csv

soh_df = Battery parameters/{name}soh_df.csv

tbl04 = data_with_temperature/{name}tbl04.csv
Final output: Battery parameters/results need to be fixed_filted.csv

5.5 Neural network model corrects parameters to values under 25°C, and produces two pickle files corresponding to r and ca.

After merging all NMC data and temperature-corrected results, the data is used for subsequent indicator calculation and visualization
Output:

Filtered SOH: Battery parameters_tem_fixed/{name}filtered_soh.csv

For plotting: Battery parameters_tem_fixed/{name}soh_for_line.csv

Indicator calculation
Output:

Final indicator parameter list: Battery parameters/final_α.csv
